# Interview

Example Workflow
The user enters their context (e.g., "I am a software engineer with 3 years of experience in Python and Django").

The app generates an interview question (e.g., "Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python.").

The user provides their answer.

The app evaluates the answer and provides feedback (e.g., "Your explanation is clear, but you could mention immutability as a key difference.").
